/**
 * dependency-cruiser — dependency rule for the hexagonal monorepo.
 *
 * Installed by the SDD Harness Kit (`fastify` adapter). It is the CI counterpart
 * to the GUARD_HTTP_IN_BUSINESS guard in the post-edit-quality hook: the hook
 * warns when saving a file, this fails the build. One is fast and local, the
 * other is the authority and cannot be skipped.
 *
 * Adjust the package names if your monorepo does not use packages/<name>.
