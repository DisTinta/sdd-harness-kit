CONTEXT="Repository state
- Configured stack: ${STACK}
- Branch: ${BRANCH} (expected prefix: ${BRANCH_PREFIX})
- Last commit: ${LAST_COMMIT}
- Uncommitted modified files: ${DIRTY}
- Active OpenSpec changes: ${ACTIVE_CHANGES}
- Pending tasks in active changes: ${PENDING_TASKS}

Project commands
- Tests: ${CMD_TEST:-not configured}
- Lint: ${CMD_LINT:-not configured}
- Static analysis: ${CMD_STATIC:-not configured}

Project context (read it; don't make it up — in Claude Code only CLAUDE.md is auto-loaded)
- docs/project-context.md — gotchas, real commands, conventions
- docs/backend-standards.md / docs/frontend-standards.md — stack layers
- .claude/sdd-harness.env — command and path contract (BRANCH_PREFIX, PATH_*)
- docs/openspec-tasks-mandatory-steps.md — READ IT before creating or editing any tasks.md; its
  mandatory steps are enforced by the validate-tasks hook (it will block you if they are missing)
- docs/documentation-standards.md — documentation gate before committing (docs-gate hook)

Workflow reminders
- TDD: the test is written and seen to fail before the implementation.
- Layer order: ${LAYER_ORDER:-see docs/backend-standards.md}.
- Business logic lives in ${PATH_BUSINESS:-the layer indicated in project-context}.
- OpenSpec: CREATING artifacts in propose/sync is normal. REWRITING existing specs
  to fit a code shortcut is forbidden (rule 7 / protect-specs).
  Marking tasks in tasks.md and writing reports/ is always free.
- Secrets: never paste tokens or read .env into the context. Use /privacy-ethics-check
  if the unit touches PII, auth or logging of personal data.
- MCP: Context7 for library docs (don't wait for someone to tell you «use context7»).
  Playwright MCP to demonstrate a real UI in /show-spec-working. If a server
  is disabled, say so and continue."
