#    a change arrives— or it can be the agent making the spec fit what it already
#    implemented. Only a human can tell those two cases apart, so we ask.

This is normal and frequent when working with the fluid OpenSpec flow: /opsx:apply fixes an
artifact and moves on, /opsx:sync dumps a delta onto the main spec. It is not an alarm on its own.

Legitimate: a scope change arrived, or the design turned out to be wrong, and you are updating the
specification BEFORE (or while) touching the code — rule 7 of docs/base-standards.md.

Illegitimate: you are adjusting the specification to fit code you already wrote without
the design having changed. That reverses the flow direction and leaves the change unreviewed.

Confirm if it is the first case."
